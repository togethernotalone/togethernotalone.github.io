Happy New Year! We wanted 2021 to be the year of development. Ayurveda is one of the oldest forms of medicine. It is defined as the science of life. One of the themes of Ayurveda we wanted to focus on this year is the mind-body-soul connection. It is important to find that balance in order to complete our purpose. 

We have listed some habits that you can include in your morning and evening rituals to strengthen this connection.

Reading is good for the mind. In fact, losing yourself in a good book or story has been shown to reduce your levels of stress. People who read regularly tend to sleep better, have lower stress levels, higher self-esteem, and lower rates of depression. All in all, reading is one habit that you can try during this new year to enhance your mind to improve your mental health.

Journaling is a habit that has transformed our lives. It is a form of communication. By letting out all the thoughts in your mind onto paper, your mind will be empty and free. This is a way to let go of all the stress you have! 

Meditation is a habit that is important for both your mind and soul! By quieting your mind, you are able to listen to your soul and fill your mind with positive thoughts. Meditation is a way for you to connect with your soul to find guidance in your life. Sometimes, the best way to get advice is to trust your intuition. That is your soul helping you live a better life! 

Following your intuition is good for the soul. Listening to your heart enables you to believe and trust in yourself. Trusting your gut feeling also helps you to avoid unhealthy relationships and situations. In other words, consider “following your intuition” as a habit to utilize this new year to restore your mental and spiritual health. 

Taking a walk around your neighborhood or in the park is a great way to find balance in your soul and body. Any form of exercise is good for your health, but walking is extremely powerful. You are taking the time to breathe in the oxygen that the trees are providing. This is the best way to connect with your soul. Our soul loves nature! Mother Earth has offered us so many resources. By taking a walk outside, you can better appreciate what she has given us. 

Going to bed early is good for the body. By going to bed early, you can get more hours of sleep which helps you become energized. You can wake up happier, have more confidence, and relieve stress and anxiety. You can also reinforce your physical health by protecting your heart from illness, reducing your risk of cancer, and improving your immune system. Having a good night’s rest is essential for your body to recharge.  

Oil pulling and abhyanga are two Ayurvedic practices for your body. Oil pulling is when you take a tablespoon of oil (either sesame or coconut) and swish it around your mouth for 10 to 20 minutes before or after brushing your teeth. You then spit out the oil saliva mixture in a bag and toss it in the trash. Oil pulling is the process of extracting toxins from your gums and teeth. So it is essential to spit out the mixture because it can be poisonous. Try your best to not swallow! This habit is so easy since you can do this while completing other tasks in the morning. By practicing this habit, your teeth will start to whiten, gums will become stronger, enamel will be protected, and bad breath will be eliminated. There are so many health benefits! 

Abhyanga is a form of self-care. It is when you heat up oil (almond or coconut) and massage it on your body. It is important to massage it towards your heart (up the legs, down the neck, etc.) for lymphatic drainage. Incorporating this habit into your daily regimen will moisturize and nourish your skin while building your immunity. 

These habits are a few of the numerous rituals that help develop the mind-body-soul connection. Take this time to explore the many practices that are being followed to strengthen the connection. This link helps us understand the importance of our mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional health. It is important to make sure we always take care of ourselves as we embark into this new journey that is 2021. Wishing you all a Happy, Healthy, Safe, Prosperous and Successful New Year.
