<b> Once upon a time. That's how most stories begin, don’t they? The knight in shining armor and princess work together to overcome all odds and rise up against the fire breathing dragon, who is the treacherous villain in the fairy tale. However, the villain in this story looks a little different. In this story, the antagonist is mental illness, who is more subtle and complex than the evil dragon, but just as sinister. Unfortunately, life isn’t as simple as fairy tales, and fighting for love isn’t as effortless as it seems. </b>


I remember when I saw him for the first time. He was walking down the school hallway toward me with that sweet smile on his face. It was our sophomore year of high school, and I was the new girl in town. We introduced ourselves to each other, and from that moment on, sparks fizzed into chemistry as we spent the entire afternoon together, smiling and laughing and teasing each other. That same night, I managed to convince myself that the instant chemistry I had felt was simply due to friendship, and nothing more than that.

Throughout the next two years, we became best friends. With him, I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe. I ran to him with my problems and passionately debated with him on every issue we may have had a slight disagreement on. Every day we spent together, I was falling harder and harder for him. I was certain nothing would come out of it though. But then finally, it happened. He told me that he loved me and I told him I loved him. And so began our romance. We made it to the end of our senior year, graduated and went to college together. We enjoyed our newfound freedom together as we grew stronger as a couple. He became my protector, my safe place, and keeper of my secrets. I thought this was our fairy tale, the beginning of our happily ever after.

Little did I know how depression was going to try to create chasms between us. I didn't realize anxiety was going to take his mind and go 120 mph, leaving me far, far behind. I would reach out, hoping for any glimmer of a smile, only to be met with cold silence. It felt like he was out in the middle of the ocean on a sailboat, bleakly looking out at the dark horizon as I was on the shore, shouting and screaming to get his attention so he would look my way. It was a lonely road to walk, as days passed by with only minimal communication between us. During those times, I felt like I would never be enough, and that I could never give him what he needed. I was so fixated on myself and my own hurt that I didn’t comprehend the monsters he was facing himself. 

I didn’t understand how he was breaking apart, piece by piece. I didn’t understand how he was trying to balance academics, work, his family and friends while mental illness forced him to carry the weight of his past, present, and future. I didn’t understand that anxiety was causing him to care too much, but depression was telling him to not care at all. It was a paradox too intricate and complex for someone who has not been personally diagnosed with mental illness. I had an awakening when I realized how depression whispers lies in your ear about your self-worth, your relationships, and your future. I recognized that he wasn’t sitting idly in a sailboat as I tried to communicate from the shore; he was swimming, desperately trying to reach me as the waves crashed against him. That’s when I realized my perspective was misaligned all along. 

His suffering didn’t minimize the loneliness that I felt, but instead it reminded me that we were on the same team. The conflict wasn’t me against him. It was us versus mental illness. We learned to connect in the midst of a depressive episode, and I began to learn how to support him through it. I began to truly listen to him as he explained what he was going through. He communicated how he needed me to be there for him in person, and in the times that I couldn’t be, I reminded him how much I loved him through small gestures. Whether it was by doordashing tacos to his home or by staying on facetime with him at night, I wanted to ensure he never forgot how much he meant to me, because I was beginning to understand how mental illness makes it too easy to forget. And just as I took care of him, he supported me despite all the storms I walked through and his arms were always open so I could run right to him no matter what. We protected each other throughout every season, regardless of what came our way.

Loving someone with mental illness is not a simple endeavor. Love is a verb, just as John Mayer sang, and it means every day when you wake up, you choose that person. Below, I have some resources that opened my eyes as we began this journey toward healing and recovery. I still have so much to learn about how to support my fiance in the midst of mental illness, but with honest, raw dialogue and vulnerability, I will be there for him just as he is always here for me. And we’ll live happily ever after.
